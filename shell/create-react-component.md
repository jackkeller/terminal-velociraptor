# create-react-component Readme

> You can sort of ignore everything before line 16, you could swap out different colors perhaps and modify to suit but this stuff is mostly icing atop the cake.

In this example there's an assumption that you're storing your React components inside the `src/` directory, which you should, however you could change lines 19, 23, & 24 to something like `src/components/` if you prefer them there. The world is your oyster!

On line 32, you may not have this type of import, or maybe it's somewhere else, be mindful of that when you're implementing this script.

You can also track through the code and change the scss to sass, css, or stylus, or ... Heck, you can even delete the .stories.js file if you're not running [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)!

Once created just make sure you `chmod +x` the script you've created and call it as `./script-name.sh` and get to work!
